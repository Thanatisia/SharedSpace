Accounting Financial Statement Book Database Management System (Balance Sheet DBMS)
```
> Background Information
	Make a Financial Statement book Database manager with SQLite
	- Cross Platform between
		- Mobile Development (Android) (Java-XML) and
		- PC (Windows / Linux) (Python-TKinter)
	- Refer to financial balance sheet on mobile's list (YYYY - MM list)

> Features
	- Basics
		C : [
				Create a profile for user - 1 table for each user,
		]
		R : [
				Read Database
		]
		U : [
				Update Database - table according to current user
		]
		D : [
				Delete Records
		]
	- For Mobile
		- same as basics but includes the following because
		Android creates the SQLite file in internal private storage (not visible unless rooted) 
		B : [
				Backup database file - export to android external root directory (Home directory)
		],
		R : [
				Restore database file - import to android internal private storage directory where program will read the files from and,
				Restart application
		]
