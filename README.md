## Information

### DESCRIPTION
```
This is my Repository created for Consolidation/Compilation of Documentations, Guides, Tips n Tricks as well as a One-stop-Shop of different topics, Concepts. 
- Initially Named 'SharedSpace' as its primary invoker was due to wanting a folder to share between my devices and use for my reference - as well as documentations, guides, tips n tricks etc. for tech, infosec, programming and anything else.
- Currently it has been remodelled to being an All-in-One documentation space for me to find all my guides.
