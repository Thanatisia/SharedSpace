# Blockchain - Terminologies

```
Compilation of terminologies in Blockchain Cryptography
```
- Chain : A series of blocks that are joined together in a chain-like fashion
	+ Changes made to the block's transaction before it [(i-1)th block] will affect and modify the hash value of the current block (i-th)
- Blocks : Each individual block represents a transaction made by an individual from one wallet to another
- Nonce : Abbreviation for "Number only used once", is like a counter/number added to a hashed/encrypted block in a blockchain when rehashed, meets the difficulty level restrictions
	+ All blocks must meet a certain level of difficulty
