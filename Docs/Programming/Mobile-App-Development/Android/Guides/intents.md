# Android App Development - Intents

## Information
### Basics
- In Android, Intents are like a declaration of actions that a user is about to take.
- 3/4 of the component types are activated by an Asynchronous message
	- This message is called an "Intent"
- Intents are like messengers that request for an action to be taken from other components, and/or Activity (page)
	- The request intents will bind the individual components to each other at runtime.
