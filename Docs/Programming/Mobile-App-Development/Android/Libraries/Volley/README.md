# Android Library - Volley

## Information
### DESCRIPTION
```
Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking very easy and fast, for Android apps. 

It was developed by Google and introduced during Google I/O 2013. 
It was developed because there is an absence in Android SDK, of a networking class capable of working without interfering with the user experience. 

Although Volley is a part of the Android Open Source Project(AOSP), 
    Google announced in January 2017 that Volley will move to a standalone library. 
    
It manages the processing and caching of network requests and it saves developers valuable time from writing the same network call/cache code again and again. 
Volley is not suitable for large download or streaming operations since Volley holds all responses in memory during parsing.
