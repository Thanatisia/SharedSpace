# Mobile Application Development - Android: Generating a new project from scratch

## Information
### Introduction

### Notes
```
The project filesystem structure may be different depending on the programming language used.

For example, Android native programming languages like Java may have different project filesystem structure than Cross-Platform languages like Kotlin, or cross-platform frameworks like React Native using Javascript and Flutter using Dart

However, for the most part, the structure should be pretty much similar
