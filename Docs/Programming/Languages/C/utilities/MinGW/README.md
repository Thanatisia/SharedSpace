### Introduction
- MinGW
    + MinGW ("Minimalist GNU for Windows"), formerly mingw32, is a free and open source software development environment to create Microsoft Windows applications.
    - MinGW includes 
        - a port of the 
            + GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), 
            + GNU Binutils for Windows (assembler, linker, archive manager), 
        - a set of 
            + freely distributable Windows specific header files and 
            + static import libraries which enable the use of the Windows API, 
        - a Windows native build of the 
            + GNU Project's GNU Debugger, and 
            + miscellaneous utilities.
    - MinGW also includes common linux development utilities such as
        + Bash
        + Git
    - MinGW, being a project based on porting of common development tools and utilities from Linux to Windows, has common alternatives such as 
        + Cygwin : Cross-Native solution where instead of being Cross-hosted on Linux like MinGW, Cygwin runs Linux applications on Windows with a compatibilitym layer

    - Mingw-w64 is an advancement of the original mingw.org project, 
        + created to support the GCC compiler on Windows systems. 
        + It has forked it in 2007 in order to provide support for 64 bits and new APIs. 
        + It has since then gained widespread use and distribution.
    + The development and community are very active and welcoming with new contributors every month and simple installers
