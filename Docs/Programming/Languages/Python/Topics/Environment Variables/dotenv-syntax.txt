# Documentation - Python : Environment Variables

Syntax and Usage of the [python-dotenv] package

## Synopsis

### Background

Use python-dotenv to load .env files into the [os.environ] dictionary

### Information

Module/Library : python-dotenv
Submodule : load_dotenv

### Syntax

load_dotenv('/path/to/project/.env')

- NOTES
	* Leave it empty to search current working directory

	> The load_dotenv() function will look for a file named '.env' in the current directory and
		* will add all the variable definitions in it to the [os.environ] dictionary.

	> If a .env file is not found in the current directory, then the parent directory is searched for it.
		> The search keeps going up in the directory hierarchy until 
			* a .env file is found OR
			* the top-level directory is reached

	> To prevent python-dotenv from searching for a .env file through your directories
		> Pass an explicit path to your file as an argument to load_dotenv()
			* load_dotenv('/path/to/project/.env')
