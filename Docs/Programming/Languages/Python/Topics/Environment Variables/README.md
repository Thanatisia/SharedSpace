# Documentation - Python : Environment Variables

Using Environment Variables in your program is a great way to configure your python program, allowing user personalization without the need to edit the source code when the config changes.

This also allows a user to specify their own parameters programatically via a personal script before running the program as well as improve security as you do not need to push your Keys/private data into your repository.

Some configuration items typically passed as environment Variables
	* 3rd-party API Keys
	* Authenticators
	* Network Ports
	* Database Server Specifications
	* Custom Options
	* Modifiable/Personal info
	* Username / Password
