# Python Basics - Opening Modes

```
Write-up of different file opening Modes available in Python

different programming/scripting languages may have 
different ways of representing modes, thus I am seperating this modes list into the various language docs
```

## Write Modes
- w : Write Mode
	+ Overwrite the file and erases all contents before writing
- w+ : Append Mode
	+ Opens the file with Write + Read access
- a : Append Mode
	+ Opens the file to append the new content into the file as a new line

## Read Modes
- r : Read Mode
	+ Opens the file to read
- r+ : Read + Write Mode
	+ Opens the file to read with ability to write
