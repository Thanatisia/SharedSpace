## Introduction
### Purpose
- i.e. General, systems programming, scripting, etc
### Use-Cases
+ Project examples, area of uses

## Setup
### Dependencies
### Pre-Requisites
### Compilation
+ Steps to compile (if is a compiled language)
### Installation
+ Steps to install the language
### Running
+ How to run/compile the source code
### Project Workspace structure
+ A project workspace structure template to follow

## Tools
### Compiler/Interpreters
+ List of compiler/interpreters used for this language
### LSP
+ List of LSPs used for this language

## Terminologies
### Implementation vs Definition vs Declaration
- Declaration: 
    ```
    The introduction of a variable into the project scope, but does not do anything with it yet. 
    Effectively just saying "Hey, this is variable <variable name>, you will meet him later"
    ```
- Definition:
    ```
    Giving the variable a value, a meaning to its existence, providing data to that variable to prepare for use
    ```
- Implementation:
    ```
    The usage of the defined variable/object within the codebase
    ```
### JIT (Just-in-Time)

### LSP 
+ The LSP is the language server pack

### Runtime vs Compile-time

### Types of languages
- Compiled
    + These languages first have the project source codes compiled by the compiler into a standalone binary/executables file
    - Examples
        + C
        + C++
        + C#
        + Java
        + etc
- Interpreted
    + These languages, some may also be known as 'scripting' languages, are 'interpreted' or iterated line by line by the runner/interpreter and executed accordingly
    - Examples
        + Python
        + Shellscript-Bash
        + Batch
        + etc
### Static-Typing vs Dynamic Typing
+ The ability to automatically estimate and detect what data type the object is

## Beginner's Concepts
### Number Systems
- Binary
### Language Syntax
+ The language's syntax
### Data Types
+ Integer
+ Float
+ Double
+ Character
+ String (an array of characters)
### Variables
- A variable is a memory object that stores data into a memory address/space (mentioned more later) so that it can be called/pulled/referenced/reused later in the program lifecycle
- A variable is effectively a key-value mapping, where 
    + the variable name is the key and 
    + the variable data is the data value
### Data Objects
+ Staticly-defined Single Value/Index-based: Arrays
+ Dynamic Single Value/Index-based: Lists/Vectors/ArrayList
+ Key-Value: Dictionary/Map/HashMap/Associative Array
### Functions
- Entry point (main) : This is where the compiler will look for to start the compilation at compile-time
### Libraries
- Importing External objects
### Paradigms
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    - Pillars of OOP
        + Polymorphism : The ability/capability to convert/transform data from one type to another type through methods when required
        + Inheritance  : The ability/capability to transfe/"inherit" properties, attributes and permissions from a parent class into the child class(es)
        + Encapsulation: The ability/capability to "encrypt" or "encapsulate" data objects or attributes so that only specific target users are able to access it, and only when required for security purposes
    - Classes
### Language-Specific
- Features and Functionalities

## Advanced Concepts
### Computer Architecture
- Little Endian vs Big Endian
    - Little Endian
    - Big Endian
### Memory Architecture
- Stack
- Positioning
### Memory Constructs/Objects
- Buffer
