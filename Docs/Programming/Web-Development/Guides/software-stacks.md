# Web Development Stacks

## Basics

### Introduction
```
A Stack is a combination of various technologies, programming languages and their modules, libraries and frameworks.
- Basically, it is a collection of different independent components that works together to support the creation/generation, setup, development and execution of an application.

Anything can have a Stack
	- Software Development (Commonly known as Software Stack)
	- Web Development
	- Mobile Development

The components of a Stack varies based on requirements by the platform.

## Stacks
### Web Development Stacks
- LAMP : Abbreviation of the top 4 technologies used to host and launch a Dynamic Website
	- Stands for
		+ Linux         : Operating System
		+ Apache        : Open-Source Webserver
		+ MySQL/MariaDB : Open-Source Database Management System
		+ PHP           : Open Source Server-Side Web Development Language
- MEAN :
	- Stands for
		+ MongoDB    : Database; Cross-Platform, Document-oriented scalable NoSQL database
		+ Express.js : Server-side/backend; Programming Language; Layered on top of NodeJS. It supports the backend framework and makes it simpler to write backend code.
		+ Angular.js : Client-side/frontend; Front-end javascript framework used for creating user interfaces
		+ Node.js    : Server-side/backend; Web Server; The NodeJS Javascript runtime environment that allows users to run code on the server without a DOM
- MERN : A common alternative to the MEAN stack, where Angular.js is replaced by React.js
	- Stands for
		+ MongoDB    : Database; Cross-Platform, Document-oriented scalable NoSQL database
		+ Express.js : Server-side/backend; Programming Language; Layered on top of NodeJS. It supports the backend framework and makes it simpler to write backend code.
		+ React.js   : Client-side/frontend; Front-end javascript framework used for creating user interfaces
		+ Node.js    : Server-side/backend; Web Server; The NodeJS Javascript runtime environment that allows users to run code on the server without a DOM
- MEVN : Open source Javascript software stack that utilises Vue.js to effectively design frontend and backend development
	- Stands for
		+ MongoDB    : Database; Cross-Platform, Document-oriented scalable NoSQL database
		+ Express.js : Server-side/backend; Programming Language; Layered on top of NodeJS. It supports the backend framework and makes it simpler to write backend code.
		+ Vue.js     : Client-side/frontend; Client-side framework used in front-end web development to create user interfaces.
		+ Node.js    : Server-side/backend; Web Server; The NodeJS Javascript runtime environment that allows users to run code on the server without a DOM
