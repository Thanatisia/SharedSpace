# Hugo - Quickstart

## Setup
### Dependencies

### Pre-Requisites

### Generating File structure
- Generate new site
    - Explanation
        - Hugo will generate the project structure for the site with the following contents
            - site-project-name/
                - archetypes/ : This contains template files that will be referenced into newly-created page files; default.md is created using 'hugo new'
                - content/ : This is where you place markdown files that hugo will take (i.e. pages) to generate HTML files from and create a new webdirectories from them; static files generated will be placed in 'static/' folder
                - data/
                - layouts/
                - public/ : Empty directory by default; running 'hugo' with no options will generate the site and place into the public directory
                - static/ : This folder is where you put all the files that are not webpages (i.e. static resource files, images, documents you want people to download); static files generated by hugo when deploying will be placed here
                - themes/ : This folder contains your themes, you do not need to touch it anymore unless you want to add more themes
                - config.toml : This is the main configuration file
        - The important directories are
            - content
            - static
    ```console
    hugo new site [site-project-name]
    ```

- Change directory into the newly-generated site project
    ```console
    cd site-project-name
    ```

- Prepare a theme template
    + Clone the template repository into folder 'themes'
        ```console
        git clone [theme-git-url] themes/[theme-name]
        ```

- Edit Configuration file
    + File Name: 'config.toml'
    - Append the theme into your configuration file
        - Explanation
            - This is your primary configuration file
                + by adding the line `theme = '[theme-name]'`, hugo will apply the theme to your site
        ```toml
        # config.toml

        ...
        theme = '[theme-name]'
        ...
        ```

- Copy the example 'style.css' file from the theme directory into your main project folder 'static/'
    - Explanation
        + You want to edit those files including the css which will contain your website contents anyways
        + So by copying it over, you can edit them
    ```console
    cp themes/[theme-name]/static/style.css static/
    ```

### Startup hugo
- Deploy to public
    ```console
    hugo
    ```
- Startup hugo server with realtime change
    ```console
    hugo server
    ```
- Startup with draft
    ```console
    hugo {-D | --buildDrafts}
    ```

### Creating new contents
- Content subdirectory structure
    - Explanation
        - Hugo's content directory contains support for subdirectories that are effectively 'branches' or categories
        - Placing files in the root of the 'content/' folder will be accessible in the root
        - i.e. to access the suburls
            + `[protocol]://[domain]:[port]/[suburls]`
    - Example
        - site-project-name/
            - content/
                - posts/ : This is where you place all your posts (i.e. blog pages)

- To generate a new content
    - Explanation
        + This generates a new markdown file containing the contents of your pages
    - new content (Default)
        ```console
        hugo new [content-file-name]
        ```
    - new content in a subdirectory
        - i.e. new posts
            ```console
            hugo new posts/[content-file-name]
            ```

- Edit your new content file
    - Explanation
        - Header of your file
            - Information
                - The header of each markdown file effectively specifies the description/details of that page with Special key-values
                    - i.e.
                        + tags : This is a list of tags/identifiers that allows hugo to filter
            - Format
                ```markdown
                ---
                title: "your-page-title"
                date: "date-of-generating"
                tags: ['list', 'of', 'all', 'tags']
                ---
                ```
