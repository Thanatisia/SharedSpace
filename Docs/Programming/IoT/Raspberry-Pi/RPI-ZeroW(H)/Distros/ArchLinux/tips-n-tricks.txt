1. Automount
```
- You need to set your target bootable partitions mapped to the drive into the /etc/fstab file 
- Manually, you need to type in the 
	UUID (obtainable via blkid [partition_label]), [mount-directory], [partition-filetype] [permissions] [start-bit] [stop-bit]
- However, there is a automatic way
```
# 1. If you are using an ArchLinux-based host
	"""
	- Use genfstab
	Package Name: genfstab
	Located in: arch-install-scripts
	Syntax: genfstab -U [mount-directory] >> [root-directory]/etc/fstab
	- With this, you can automatically generate the filesystems table of all mounted directories
		- If you have other mounted directories within the source mount directory, 
			genfstab will detect and add those entries as well
			- i.e.
				let partitions be
					/dev/sdX1 : /mnt/boot
					/dev/sdX2 : /mnt
					/dev/sdX3 : /mnt/home
				- Note that the boot and home partitions are all within the root point itself
				genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
					- genfstab will generate the blkid for /mnt, /mnt/boot and /mnt/home
	"""
	genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

# 2. If you are not using ArchLinux
	TBC
