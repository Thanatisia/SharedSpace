# Data Structures

## Information
### Summary
+ Data Structures in Software Development and Computer Science are effectively memory containers as well as methods of structuring data objects together (aka Data Structures)

### Terminologies
+ Buffer : Buffer are temporary memory container/objects which is mapped to a memory address to hold data

## Data Entities
+ Array : An Indexed memory object that (typically) holds data of a specified data type up to a specified maximum memory space
+ ArrayList/List/Vector : Lists are effectively Arrays with undefined sizes such that it's element size will expand/reduce without having a specified memory size
+ Dictionary/HashMap/Associative Array/Map : A Key-Value Data object container type that mapped a key to a value. Dictionaries are not sorted by index but instead, by the hash value of the key
+ Linked List : A chain of memory addresses that are linked/chained by the last element of the previous chain and the first element of the next chain; Changes made to the previous nodes will affect the subsequent nodes
