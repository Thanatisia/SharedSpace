- DNS Adblocking, Firewall and Server via VPN Connection
    Purpose: This allows a user connecting to the Home Network via VPN to automatically be connected to the DNS Server (pihole) as well by default
        - This allows the user to automatically be able to use local domain names in the home network from the external network.
