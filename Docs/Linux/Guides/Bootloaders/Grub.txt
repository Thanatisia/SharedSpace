## Boot Entries in [/boot/grub/grub.cfg]

- A basic GRUB config file uses the following options
	* (hdX,Y) is the partition Y on disk X, partition numbers starting at 1, disk numbers starting at 0
	* set default=N is the default boot entry that is chosen after timeout for user action
	* set timeout=M is the time M to wait in seconds for a user selection before default is booted
	* menuentry "title" {entry options} is a boot entry titled title
	* set root=(hdX,Y) sets the boot partition, where the kernel and GRUB modules are stored (boot need not be a separate partition, and may simply be a directory under the "root" partition (/)

- Boot menu entry

	Syntax:
