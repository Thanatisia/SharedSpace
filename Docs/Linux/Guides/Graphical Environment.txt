# Setting Up #
#============#

- Install Display Server:
	```
	The Display Server [xorg] and 
	- related packages:
		xorg-xinit : For Startx
	- For X11 usage and Graphical Display
	```
	- X
		# If your distro is
		Arch-based :
			sudo pacman -S xorg
			sudo pacman -S xorg-xinit

- Install Desktop Environment / Window Manager
	- Desktop Environments
		- GNOME
		- KDE
			If your distro is Debian:
				sudo apt-get install kde-plasma
		- XFCE
	- Window Managers
		- bspwm
			via Package Manager:
				If your distro is 
					Debian (via Apt):
						# Install bspwm
							sudo apt-get install bspwm
						# Install sxhkd
							sudo apt-get install sxhkd
					Arch (via Pacman):
						# Install bspwm
							sudo pacman -S bspwm
						# Install sxhkd
							sudo pacman -S sxhkd
			via Manual:	
				```
				NOTE:
					- With this method, you might need to install additional dependencies or have missing libraries you need to download seperately
						References: https://askubuntu.com/questions/392718/problems-installing-bspwm

						If your distro is Debian-based:
							- Install package [apt-file]
								# This program will find the relevant package for the library
									sudo apt-get install apt-file

								# Update after finding
									sudo apt-file update
									Syntax: apt-file search "library_header_fullname"
									Usage: 
										apt-file search "X11/extensions/Xinerama.h"

								# Install returned package
				```
				# Clone Make and Install bspwm
					git clone https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm.git
					make && sudo make install
				# Clone, Make and Install sxhkd
					git clone https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd.git
					make && sudo make install	
	
- Setup Configs
	- Desktop Environments / Window Managers
		- Window Managers
			- bspwm
				```
				Steps:
					1. Make Directories [~/.config/bspwm, ~/.config/sxhkd]
					2. Copy bspwmrc and sxhkdrc examples to ~/.config/bspwm and ~/.config/sxhkd
					3. Change permissions of bspwmrc and sxhkdrc to Executable for use
				```
				- Make Directories [~/.config/bspwm, ~/.config/sxhkd]
					mkdir -p ~/.config/bspwm ~/.config/sxhkd
				- Copy bspwmrc and sxhkdrc examples to ~/.config/bspwm and ~/.config/sxhkd
					cp /usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/bspwmrc ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc
					cp /usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/sxhkdrc ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc
				- Change permissions of bspwmrc and sxhkdrc to Executable for use
					chmod +x ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc
					chmod +x ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc



- (OPTIONAL) Setup xinitrc (if using startx - no display manager)
	```
	The '.xinitrc' dotfile is the X initialization Resource Control file
	- Used alongside startx as a settings file to know what to run when passed
	
	- Contents to put into .xinitrc:
		- Things to run automatically when 'startx' or 'sx' is ran
	NOTES:
		- Try not to put too many functions here as this file is processed on every startx
			- The more you put, the longer it will take to startup the graphical environment

		- Place functions that requires a one-time startup load (i.e. Networking startup etc.) in
			~/.bash_profile (bash shell profile) or 
			~/.profile (generic shell profile) or
			~/.zsh_profile (ZSH shell profile)
		  to reduce the amount of workload on the startup process

		- Place '&' behind commands in .xinitrc to run them in the background

	Syntax: startx ~/.xinitrc {params}
	```
	echo "exec [wm | de]" >> ~/.xinitrc


- (OPTIONAL) Setup .{bash_|zsh_}profile
	```
	The profile files related to the default shell will be executed on first startup
	- i.e. on the first bash/zsh startup after logging in
		- .profile will be ran (general)
		- .bash_profile will be ran (if shell is Bash)
		- .zsh_profile will be ran (if shell is Zsh)

	File: ~/.{bash_|zsh_}profile
	```
	# One-time Network setup (if you dont want to enable Network automatically)
		echo "sudo systemctl start NetworkManager" | tee -a ~/.bash_profile
