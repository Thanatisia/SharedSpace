# Linux - Permissions

```
Permissions in an Operating System is essential to ensure that the different levels in a OS' filesystem hierarchy does not touch or manage files that they have no rights to. 
This is for enhancing security.

In Windows, Permissions are handled by Domains where the top level domain is the C:\ drive
In Linux, Permissions are handled by modifiers and numeric values
```

- Permissions
	```
	Permissions in Linux are represented by 3 modes

	- Each path, directory and files are made up of 3 sections
		+ with each section being represented by the permission modifiers.
	- Every modifier space in each section is assigned to a numeric value.
	- The permission calculation for the section is calculated by 
		+ Adding up all the numeric values assigned to each modifier space in a section (Refer to 'chmod calculation' for more information)	
	```
	- Modifiers
		+ r : Read
		+ w : Write
		+ e : Executable

- Structure
    + Consists of either r (Read), w (Write), x (Executable)
    - First bit = File Type (T)
        + _ = File
        + D = Directory
        + L = Link
    - Every space in a given block/section (for example - 234)
	+ Is made up of Read (r), Write (w) and Execute (x) - In that order
    ```
    _/___/___/___
    T/234/567/890
      rwx/rwx/rwx
    ```

- chmod calculation
    - Permission Modifiers Numerical Values
        + r : 4 : Read
        + w : 2 : Write
        + x : 1 : Executable

    - Calculation
	1. The first block (consisting of only 1 space) is the file/folder type.
	2. Scan through each section
		2.1. Convert all spaces within the section/block that has a permission modifier key into a Numerical value as specified in [Permission Modifiers Numerical Values]
			+ every space in the section/block that does not have a permission (empty) will be considered a 0
		2.2. Calculate and add all of the numerical values together
			+ The number will be the permission for that block
	3. After completing the calculation of all 3 sections
		- the 3 numbers obtained from the calculation will be concatenated together to be formed the chmod permission modifier
			+ This permission will determine if a file can be read, written and/or executed depending on the permission modifiers calculated.

    - Examples
        + _rwxrwxrwx = _/rwx/rwx/rwx = _/4+2+1/4+2+1/4+2+1 = _/7/7/7 = 777
        + _rwxr_xr_x = _/rwx/rx/r_x = _/4+2+1/4+1/4_1 = _/7/5/5 = 755
        + drwxr-xr-x = d/rwx/r_x/r_x = d/4+2+1/4+1/4+1 = d/7/5/5 = 755
        + -rw-r--r-- = _/rw_/r__/r__ = _/4+2/4/4 = _/6/4/4 = 644
