# Steps to create a disk image file (.img) with multiple partitions and filesystem types for Linux installation

```
These are the steps to create a Linux filesystem from a raw disk image file (.img) with multiple partitions and filesystem types

- to allow automated linux installation into an image file
```

## Setup
### Pre-Requisites

### Commands
+ dd : Disk Destroyer
+ parted : Partition manager CLI utility
+ losetup : Loopback setup CLI utility

## Steps

### dd create image file
dd if=/dev/zero of=[image file] bs=1024 count=[size of file]

### Create partition table in image file
parted [image file] mklabel [msdos|gpt]

### Create Partitions in disk (raw) image file partition table
parted [image file] mkpart [disk/partition label] [filesystem type] [start size] [end size]

### Mount it as a loopback device (simplest way to define cylinders, heads and sectors)
- Mount file as loopback device
    + -P will create loop devices for each partition (important)
    losetup -Pf [image file] # Find image file

- Validate loopback device is created
    losetup -a # Find all loopback addresses

### Check your loopback device's partiton
sudo fdisk -l

### Partition your image file in the loopback interface
```
Note: From this point on, each loopback device is treated as a partition
    parted /dev/loop[loopback-number]p[partition-number]
```
- Format loopback device partitions
    - fat32
        mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/loop[loopback-number]p[partition-number]
    - ext4
        mkfs.ext4 /dev/loop[loopback-number]p[partition-number]

- Set filesystem as bootable
    parted /dev/loop[loopback-number] set 1 boot on

### Mount your mount path to the partitions
mount [loopback-partition] [mount path]

### Perform your actions
> Perform all other actions here

### Unloop the device (need unmapping and unmounting first)
- Unmount
    umount -l [mount path]

- Unloop
    losetup -d /dev/loop[loopback-number]
