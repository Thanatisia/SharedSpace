#==========================
# /etc/hosts file
# for the container
#
# This is where you map the host names of your webservices
#   to the IP address of your webservices.
#
# - Essentially, this is where the Reverse Proxy server's Domain name setting for DNS takes place
#   - DNS will map the IP address to a domain name
#   - A Reverse Proxy server will be able to take that domain name and map a path to the IP address as a URL
