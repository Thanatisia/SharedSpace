# Media Servers

```
Media Servers are platform/devices used generally to host and storage Media Entertainment Contents such as Videos, Music, Images and even Games (though these are usually in dedicated Game Servers).
- These files will then be streamed by the Media Clients when the Client devices are connected to the servers

In the context of a Home/Small-Scale Server system, a Media Server can be in the form of a small NAS/Network File Sharing Server that has a folder with the Media Contents meant for Streaming.

Examples of Large-Scale Media Server Platforms are
- Netflix
