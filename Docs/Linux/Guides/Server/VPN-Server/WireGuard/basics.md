# WireGuard VPN server basics

## Basics
### Introduction
- Wireguard is a new VPN protocol that focuses on Peer-to-Peer connection using various secured encryption algorithms to create an encrypted tunnel between the user and the VPN server.
- Wireguard is just about 4000 lines in the codebase.
    - This means it is light(er)weight and easier to refactor as compared to IPSec or OpenVPN
