Proxmox - Basics

## DESCRIPTION
```
Proxmox is a Type-1 Hypervisor Operating System and is used to make any hardware (even the older hardware) into a multi-server Home Lab
```

## Background
+ A Hypervisor is a Virtualization technology that allows an operating system/kernel to actualize and run another Operating System

+ A type-2 hypervisor is a software-based hypervisor that runs off an existing operating system like VirtualBox, VMWare
    - Need to share OS resources between the host and the Hypervisor

+ A type-1 hypervisor operates and runs off bare-metal from ground up, meaning the CPU and GPU is entirely usable by the hypervisor

## System Features
- Containers
    + Proxmox uses LXC - A Linux Containerization platform - instead of Docker

## Notes
- Proxmox doesnt use WiFi, only Ethernet
- Proxmox may ask you to check out subscription
	- The subscription is primarily just to provide services, you can just ignore it to use the full program
