		- disconnected : No connection/output is found
		- primary : Your main connected monitor - i.e. monitor [1]
			- All subsequent monitors do not have 'primary'
	# Resolution Structure
		- Resolution is usually displayed in the following strcture: [width]x[height]+[x-axis]+[y-axis]
			

Using xrandr:
```
All Parameters:
	-q : Query Monitors
	--output [target-monitor] 	: Select an output monitor
	--mode [resolution]		: Set resolution of [target-monitor]
	--rate [framerate]		: Set [target-monitor]'s refresh rate
	--primary 			: Set [target-monitor] as the primary monitor
	--left-of [target-monitor] 	: Set position of selected monitor to the left of a specified monitor
	--right-of [target-monitor] 	: Set position of selected monitor to the right of a specified monitor
```
	# To query your monitors for all information
		```
		Information consists of:
			- How your system is referencing them
			- available resolutions
			- refresh rates
		Syntax: xrandr -q

		Notes:
			- Output template:
				# Each Listing entry is arranged in the following format:
					[Connection-Method]-[connection-ID] {connected|disconnected} {other_keywords} {resolution+position} (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) n1mm x n2mm
		```
		
	# To set your monitor resolution
		```
		Syntax: xrandr --output [target-monitor] {options}
 		Options:
			--mode [resolution ([width]x[height])] 	: 
			--rate [framerate]			: Set your monitor's refresh rate
		```
	
	# Multi-monitor support
		```
		Syntax: xrandr --output [selected-monitor] {options}
		Options:
			--primary : Specify and Set [selected-monitor] as the primary monitor
			--left-of [target-monitor] : Set position of selected monitor to the left of a specified monitor
