1. Multiline Comments
	#############
	#  Methods	#
	#############
	i. Using ':'
		Description
		- ':' is shorthand for true and
		- true does not process any parameters
		- You can add a '#' on the last line behind the ' to enable and disable the comment
		Syntax
		[1]
		: '
			Line_1
			Line_n
		' 
		[2]
		: "
			Line_1
			Line_n
		"
	ii. Using heredoc << redirect
		Description:
		- This is a heredoc (<<) redirected to a NOP command (:) as a multi-line string.
		
		- The single quotes around END_COMMENT are important,
			- because it disables variable resolving and commands resolving within these lines. 
			- Without the single-quotes around END_COMMENT, the commands in the comment would get executed
		Syntax
		[1]
		: <<'END_COMMENT'
		line_1 
		line_n
		END_COMMENT
