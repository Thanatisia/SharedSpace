1. Know the use for each file in the filesystem
	[user dotfiles]
	.bash_profile : 
		- Put functions in here to load on the first startup of bash 
			(if you are using tty - it's after the login)
	.bashrc : 
		- aka Bash Resource Control file
		- What to run whenever bash starts up
	.xinitrc :
		- X Initialization Resource Control file 
		- What to run when X first starts up (startx)
	.Xresources : 
		- X Resources file 
		- A resource control file that stores colours, details 
		- used by Xorg applications

2. Recommendations
	1. Put all initialization functions in .bash_profile (on startup) instead of .xinitrc
		- This is so that there will not be any bottlenecks on startup of X 
			- because it is initialized on startup 
		- i.e.
			- Network Setup
			- Bluetooth Setup
