1. Verifying if package is installed
	Description
	- use 'pacman -Qi "$package_name" &> /dev/null
		- The usage of '-i' instead of '-s' ensures that you will check for exactly that package
			- and not for the presence of a package containing the package name in its name
		- &> /dev/null will redirect any stderr output to /dev/null so you dont see the output
	Functions
	is_package_installed()
	{
		# --- Input
		
		# command line arguments
		package_name="${1:-""}"

		# --- Processing
		pacman -Qi "$package_name" &> /dev/null

		# --- Output
		echo "$?"
	}
