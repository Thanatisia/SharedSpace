	 .bashrc : The Bash Resource Control File; A settings file for bash that contains various configuration such as Environment Variables; local variables; autostarts etc. The bashrc is read everytime the shell is started and/or a new Terminal is open
	 .bash_profile : The Bash Profile File; This file is called only during the login/initial login to the shell (i.e. if you are using the tty to login and not a display manager - the bash_profile will be sourced after loggig in).
	 .inputrc : Used by all shell (typically used by bash) to edit or interact with the command line (i.e. change settings, keybindings etc)
