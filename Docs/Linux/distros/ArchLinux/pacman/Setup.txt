## Information

Fixes and Issues with ArchLinux Distro-specified Issues such as
- pacman
	+ keyring

## Setup

- Initialize Keyring
	- The randomness created is used to initialize the keyring (/etc/pacman.d/gnupg) and the GPG signing key of your system
	- NOTE:
		- This process requires entropy
		- To generate entropy : Move your mouse around, press random characters on the keyboard or run some disk-based activity.
		- Initialization may take longer if the system does not have enough sufficient entropy
	```
	pacman-key --init
	```

- Verify master keys
	```
	pacman-key --populate archlinux
	```

## Post-Installation

- Adding Developer Keys
	```
	- The [archlinux-keyring] package is a dependency of pacman
		- Contains the latest keys
	```

- Adding Unofficial Keys
	```
	Get the Key ID (keyid) from its owner
	```
	- If the key is found on a key server
		- Import into Keyring
			```
			pacman-key --recv-keys [keyid]
			```
	- If a link to a keyfile is provided
		- Download keyfile
		- Import into keyring
			```
			pacman-key --add /path/to/downloaded/keyfile
			```

- Verify fingerprints
	```
	pacman-key --finger [keyid]
	```

- Locally sign the imported key
	```
	pacman-key --lsign-key [keyid]
	```
