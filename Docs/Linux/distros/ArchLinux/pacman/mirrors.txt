# ArchLinux - repository mirrors

- Pacman Mirrors Location : /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

```
ArchLinux uses the pacman package manager

Pacman's repository mirrors are found in '/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist'
	+ This file dictates the links of pacman package mirrors and 
	- The file follows a downwards hierarchy
		+ The top mirror URL will be searched first followed the next all the way down
		+ Thus, please place the mirror that's closest to your region at the top positions
```

- To update mirrors
	- Open /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
		+ Comment out the repositories mirror url
	- Refresh and Upgrade your pacman cache
		```console
		sudo pacman -Syu
		```
