# Files to be removed

All files here are temporarily placed here while they are still being migrated to the designated repository.

Currently the designated repository is my Linux Installation Guides (Base Installation, Post Installation and Installation Scripts) etc.

- Repository link will be in [here](https://github.com/Thanatisia/toc-linux-guides)

After migration is completed, the files found here will be removed from this repository as they will be in an alternate location. 

Technically the contents will be exactly the same (probably arranged just differently), so no worries on missing out.
