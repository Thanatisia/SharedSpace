# Create a swap file
#

# i. Create swap file
# The “fallocate” program can create swap files faster than “dd”. As an added perk, its syntax is also easier to remember
# NOTE:
#	the swapfile/swap partition size is generally about 2x your pc/laptop's RAM - minimum 4GB as a rule of thumb
fallocate -l <size> /swapfile

# ii. Change permission of swapfile to read+write
chmod 600 /swapfile

# iii. Make swap file
mkswap /swapfile

# iv. Enable swap file to begin using it
swapon /swapfile

# v. The operating system needs to know that it is safe to use this file for swap every time it boots up
echo "# /swapfile" | tee -a /etc/fstab
echo "/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0" | tee -a /etc/fstab

# vi. Summary/write up of command
# EXAMPLE
	swapfile size = 4GB 
	fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
	chmod 600 /swapfile
	mkswap /swapfile
	swapon /swapfile
	echo "# /swapfile" | tee -a /etc/fstab
	echo "/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0" | tee -a /etc/fstab

# vii. Verify Swap file
ls -lh /swapfile

# viii. Remove Swap file
swapoff /swapfile
rm -f /swapfile
remove "/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0" from /etc/fstab
