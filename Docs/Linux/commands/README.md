## Information
### DESCRIPTION
```
Documentation and write-up of Linux Commands and its usages.

Includes other information and useful tips n tricks (In my opinion) that you and I will be able to learn regarding the usage of the command

- As much as possible, all commands found here are generally built-in to Linux/UNIX systems
    + Commands that are externally downloaded will be in the 'packages' directory

I hope this folder/repository will be of use to you as much as it did for me
