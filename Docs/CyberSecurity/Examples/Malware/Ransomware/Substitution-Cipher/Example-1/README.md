# Example Ransomware using Substitution Cipher with Public Key Encryption (Asymmetric Key)

As the name suggests, this example is using Substitution Cipher to encrypt all .txt files with a randomly-scrambled alphabet-turned Cipher List.

## Setup

### Pre-Requisites
+ python
+ python-pip

### Dependencies
+ pycryptodome

## Steps and Explanation

### ransomware.py
- on activation, the payload will use Substitution Cipher to encrypt all .txt files with a randomly-scrambled alphabet-turned Cipher List.

- The files that were encrypted will then be written to an encrypted files list named 'encrypted.lst' for reference.

- The program will create a Public-Private Key Pair (Asymmetric Key) using RSA-2048 and save both the Public Key and the Private Key into a seperate file (ransompublickey.pem and ransomprvkey.pem respectively)

- The Cipher List is then saved into a key file named 'key.bin' which is then Encrypted with the generated RSA-2048 Public Key (ransompublickey.pem). This file will be decrypted later and used to decrypt and decipher the encrypted files via Reverse Substitution Cipher

### key-recovery.py
```
assuming the victim has received the 'key.bin' file which is required for file recovery as it contains the cipher list

The victim will place 'key.bin' in the same directory as the .py files
```
- on activation, the script will decrypt and decipher the 'key.bin' file using the generated RSA-2048 private key (ransomprvkey.pem) and renamed into 'key.txt'

- 'key.bin' will be deleted

### file-recovery.py
- on activation, the script will run through the encrypted files list 'encrypted.lst' and for each file
    - decrypt and decipher the current file using Reverse Substitution Cipher with the Cipher List from 'key.txt'

- on completion, 
    - for cleanup
        + the script will delete all files and keys generated for use in the ransomware
        + for display purposes, the scripts themselves wont be deleted, just the keys

## LEGAL THINGS

As mentioned in the README previously, I am not liable for any changes made to this script if you decided to clone it and edit it.

I do thank you for taking a look at this example though, and hope that this has helped you to learn more in your journey within Cybersecurity, as it helped me.
