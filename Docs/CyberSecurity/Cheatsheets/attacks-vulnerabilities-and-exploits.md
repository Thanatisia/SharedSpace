### Attacks
+ Cookie Hijacking: Aka Session Hijacking, Cookie Hijacking is when an attack takes over a user's session by "stealing" the temporary session cookie set in your browser when you logged in to a website and making use of it to take control of the website mimicking as you.
+ Pass-the-Hash Attack: An adversary steals a user's password hash and uses that credential to create a new user session on the same network (as the attacker now has the same securtiy authority level as the user).
+ Phishing : An attack that uses fraudulent emails, text messages, phone calls, websites or any medium commonly used by users to trick people into sharing sensitive data, downloading malware and or logging into the website with the intent of stealing their information (i.e. credentials - username, password, session)
+ Spear-Phishing : A type of phishing attack that targets specific individuals or organizations typically through mediums like malicious emails. The goal of spear phishing is to steal sensitive information such as login credentials or infect the targets' device with malware
+ Social Engineering : Social Engineering is the use of physical/psychological human interaction to manipulate people into sharing information that they shouldnt share once their guards are down (Related: OPSEC (Operational Security)). Through the gathering of these information (Reconnaissance, Related: Cyber Kill Chain), an attacker can manipulate and utilise these information to perform their objectives
+ Typosquatting : Also known as URL Hijacking, is a Social Engineering Attack that purposely uses mispelled domains (commonly related to famous and commonly-visited websites) with the intent to mislead the users to enter the website and fool them into logging in, thereby stealing their information/credentials
+ Watering Hole : A cyberattack that targets groups of users by infecting websites that they commonly visit. When accessing the website, the malware will be delivered and installed to the target via a drive-by attack. When installed and ran, exploit will be ran on the victims computer and report the findings back to the attack
+ Zero-Day Attack: A Zero-Day in Cybersecurity refers to any vulnerability/attack vectors that are undocumented or undisclosed to the public

### Terminologies
+ Adversary: aka Enemy/Attacker
+ Alice : Cybersecurity and Cryptography terminology representing 'User/Character A'; i.e. If B -- PK_B --> A == "If Bob sends his Public Key to Alice"
+ Bob : Cybersecurity and Cryptography terminology representing 'User/Character B'; i.e. If A -- PK_A --> B == "If Alice sends her Public Key to Bob"
+ Eve : Cybersecurity and Cryptography terminology commonly representing 'User/Character E' aka the 'Enemy'. In cryptography, Eve is commonly used as a middle-man stealing the packets during a Man-in-the-Middle attack
