# Cybersecurity: Terminologies

## Information
### Description
+ This documentation is a quick rundown cheatsheet containing a list of various cybersecurity and cryptography-related terminologies that you shoud know
+ Note: This list is incomplete and is being updated periodically 

## Contents

### General Cybersecurity
+ Blue Team: Defensive Security operations and roles that focuses on the protection of the servers and infrastructure, ensuring it stays up, as well as Research and Development and Intelligence gathering
+ Red Team : Offensive Security operations and roles involving the finding of loopholes (aka Vulnerabilities) on the server through Pentesting and Vulnerability Assessment (VA; aka Vulnerability Testing)
+ Traffic Light Prtoocol: Acronym TLP, the TLP is a set of designations used to ensure that sensitive information is shared with the appropriate audience, with each color being similar to that of a traffic light - RGB. TLP:Red = Non-Disclosure, TLP:Amber = Limited Disclosure, TLP:Green = Community Disclosure, TLP:White: Unlimited Disclosure
+ Exploits: Exploits are attacks designed around vulnerabilities, specifically the manipulation of the vulnerabilities in order to get through the "door" aka the ports of the targetted server
+ Payload: Payload refers to any intended output created by an exploit, malware or virus after being executed on a target server
+ Vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities are holes on a server that can be manipulated and exploited to gain access into the target server
+ Advance Persistent Threats (APTs) : An APT is typically a sophisticated, stealthy threat actor (or groups of threat actors) attack that has gained unauthorized access to a victim's computer and has established the ability to maintain access within the computer for an extended period of time.
+ Threat Actors (TAs) : Threat Actors are individuals or groups that targets victims to intentionally cause harm to the systems, basically anyone that performs cyber attacks
+ Operational Security (OPSEC) : OPSEC is a Security and Risk Management process that prevents sensitive information from getting into the wrong hands. Essentially, the goal of OPSEC is the safety of important, critical information trusted to an individual relating to an organization, and/or the day-to-day Business-As-Usual (BAU) Operation that cannot be revealed to unauthorized personnels.

### Cybersecurity Roles
+ Security Operations Center : aka SOC, The security operations center is the hub for most blue-teaming based jobs
+ Cybersecurity Analyst : Blue-Team role, known as the SOC Analyst, this performs the monitoring side of the Blue Team operations in any organizations, ensuring constant uptime as well as working alongside the Incident Response (IR) team to solve issues (if any)
+ Incident Response (IR): Blue-Team role. As the name suggests, the goal is to coordinate and align the key resources and team members during a cybersecurity incident to minimize impact and restore operations as quickly as possible (ASAP). An IR team is separated into teams and are deployed whenever there are any compromises or attacks detected either by the monitoring team or the victims
+ Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI): Blue-Team Role, this is the Intelligence Gathering side of the Blue-Team operations portfolio. Essentially, the primary CTI scope is to research and gather intelligence regarding potential up and coming threats (APTs), Exploits and Vulnerabilities

### Cryptography
+ Adversary: aka Enemy/Attacker
+ Alice : Cybersecurity and Cryptography terminology representing 'User/Character A'; i.e. If B -- PK_B --> A == "If Bob sends his Public Key to Alice"
+ Bob : Cybersecurity and Cryptography terminology representing 'User/Character B'; i.e. If A -- PK_A --> B == "If Alice sends her Public Key to Bob"
+ Eve : Cybersecurity and Cryptography terminology commonly representing 'User/Character E' aka the 'Enemy'. In cryptography, Eve is commonly used as a middle-man stealing the packets during a Man-in-the-Middle attack

### Networking
+ Cookie : A Cookie is a temporary file created by the webserver when logging in to a website (because HTTP(S) is stateless, hence it requires an external container to hold the states), in which, contains the state of the authentication and authorization - such as: Login Credentials (Encrypted), cookie ID, auth ID
