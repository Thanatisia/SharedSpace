## Information

### Basics

```
Hashing algorithms like the SHA-line is a "1-way" encryption algorithm.

This means that you can only encrypt the input into an output but not be able to decrypt it back to its initial input

The way you utilize a hashing algorithm is generally through a comparison approach

## Usage
- Comparison Approach
	+ User will enter an input
	+ System will hash the user's input
	+ System will retrieve a password or a text that's intended to be for the user
	+ System will hash that value
	+ System will compare the user's hash input with the retrieved text's hash value
