## Information

### Basics

```
Key Encryption algorithms, compared to the Hashing encryption algorithms like the SHA family, are a "2-way" encryption-decryption algorithm.

You can input a plaintext and encrypt into a cipher/encoder to output a encrypted ciphertext AND
	input a ciphertext and parse it through the same cipher to decode and decrypt it back to the initial plaintext
