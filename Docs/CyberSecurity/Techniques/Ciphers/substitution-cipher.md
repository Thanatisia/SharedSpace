# Ciphers

## Substitution Cipher Steps

### Encryption
- Components
    + Alphabet List : "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    + Key (A randomly scrambled/sorts alphabet list)
    + Plaintext (to Encrypt)

- Steps
    + Place the Alphabet List on top of the Key so they match letter to letter
    - Compare the 2 lists
        - Look at your ciphertext
            + Compare the characters in your ciphertext and locate it within the alphabet list
            - Once you identified the character in the alphabet list
                + Look at the corresponding character in the Key
                + This is the ciphertext character
    + Rinse and repeat to get your ciphertext

### Decryption
- Components
    + Alphabet List
    + Key (Same one used to encrypt)
    + Ciphertext (To Decrypt back to plaintext)

- Steps
    + Swap the Key with the Alphabet List
    + Place the Alphabet List on top of the Key so they match letter to letter
    - Compare the 2 lists
        - Look at your ciphertext
            + Compare the characters in your ciphertext and locate it within the key
            - Once you identified the character in the key
                + Look at the corresponding character in the Alphabet List
                + This is the plaintext
    + Rinse and repeat to get your plaintext
