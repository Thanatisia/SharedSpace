```
Compilation of terminologies and acronyms used in Cybersecurity
```

## Acronyms
+ APT = Advanced Persistent Threat
+ CII : Critical Information Infrastructure
+ OSINT : Open Source Intelligence
+ RAT : Remote Administration Tool
+ SCADA : Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition

## Terminologies
+ Blue Team : Defensive-based operations
+ Red Team : Offensive-based operations
+ Reconnaissance : Stage 1 of the Cyber Kill Chain and Ethical Hacking Lifecycle, Reconnaissance is also known as Information Gathering
- Cyber Kill Chain
    + Reconnaissance             : Information Gathering
    + Weaponization              : Coupling exploit with a backdoor into a deliverable payload for execution
    + Delivery                   : Pushing payload into victim's computer
    + Exploitation               : Exploiting a vulnerability to execute a payload
    + Installation               : Activating and executing the payload on the target/victim's system
    + Command & Control (C2|C&C) : Maintaining control and access to and from the target/victim's device and the attacker's server
    + Actions on Objectives      : Accomplishing and Execution of their original goals; Typically Exfiltration of Data
- Ethical Hacking/Penetration Testing Lifecycle
    + Reconnaissance               : Stage 1 of the Ethical Hacking Lifecycle; Information Gathering on target/victim
    + Scanning & Enumeration       : Stage 2 of the Ethical Hacking Lifecycle; Searching for vulnerabilities and attack vector to manipulate in target/victim's device
    + Gaining Access               : Stage 3 of the Ethical Hacking Lifecycle; Exploitation of vulnerabilities and gained access to target/victim's device
    + Maintaining Access           : Stage 4 of the Ethical Hacking Lifecycle; Maintaining access to target/victim's system by implementing a backdoor communication vector
    + Analysis, Report and Cleanup : Stage 5 of the Ethical Hacking Lifecycle; Providing input on your findings, and removal of all files generated from the test back to the initial state
+ Zero-Day = Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploit
+ Vulnerability : An unfixed bug/hole/security flaw within a software/firmware or even hardware that can be exploited to allow a payload or command to pass through and be executed
+ Exploit : A code that takes advantage of a Software Vulnerability or Security Flaw to allow a payload or command to pass through and be executed or other attacks
+ Payload : A Malware that the Threat Actor intends to deliver to the victim to execute on the system
+ Malware : A Malicious Software; A file or code (aka 'Software'), typically delivered over a network, designed to infect systems with the intent to explore, steal or cause damage to the system as well as other uses by the attacker to the Victim/target systems.
+ Lateral Movement : Movement within the network
+ Web Shell : A shell that lets me execute a command if gained access
- Typosquatting : A type of Social Engineering attack which targets users who incorrectly types a URL/domain rather than using a Search Engine
    + where the URL/domain typed is slightly modified from the legitimate URL/domain with the intent of tricking the user that the malicious website is the real website
