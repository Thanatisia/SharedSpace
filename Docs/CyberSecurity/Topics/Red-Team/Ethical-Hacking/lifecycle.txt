	"""
	1: Reconnaissance
		- Try and find the password into the network/'House'
			- Method of Entry
		- Gain information on the targt
		- Social Engineering
		- Phishing
		[Examples]
	2: Scanning & Enumeration
		- Try and find a way to break into the network/'House'
			- Entrance point
		- Vulnerabilities etc.
		[Examples]
		- nmap
	3: Exploitation
		- Gain access to the system
		- Successful exploit & payload
		- Gain control of the system to at least a user level
		- From user level, perform priviledge escalation to gain root access to the target
		[Examples]
		- Metasploit
	4: Persistency
		- Maintaining Access
		- Install backdoors, keyloggers, rootkits etc.
		[Examples]
	5. Clearing Tracks
		- Deleting files and removing info
		[Examples]
	6. Reporting
		- Reporting is the final part of a penetration test. 
			- It is what differentiates between an attacker and an ethical hacker.
		- Summarize all the steps taken from recon (1.) to gaining access (3.)
			- Helps the organization to understand its security architecture and defend itself better
