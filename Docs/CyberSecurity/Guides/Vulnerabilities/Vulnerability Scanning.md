# Vulnerability Scanning

## Introduction to Vulnerability Scanning
- Vulnerability scanning
    + A process of identifying and analysing the critical security flaws in the target system
- Purpose of vulnerability scanning
    + To locate and identify vulnerabilities on the targe system and provide information to the initiator of the scan
- Benefits
    + When performed properly and regularly, a vulnerability scan can provide valuable information about the security posture of an organisation’s infrastructure, technical and management policiest
    
## Tools
- Nessus
    + One of the most famous 
    + Created by: Renaud Deraison
    + Year Created: 1998
    - Overview:
        + Created by Renaud Deraison in 1998 as a free remote security scanner
        - In 2005, it became Tenable Network Security's proprietary (Closed source) product
            + Free version still available for home use
    - The basic task is to scan for vulnerabilities that would allow remote access such as
        + Misconfigurations
        + Default or common passwords
        + Denial of service attacks against the TCP/IP stack
           
- OpenVAS
    + A collection of security tools and services that provide a platform for vulnerability assessment.
    + It began as a branch from the open source Nessus tool.
    + OpenVAS has a number of different components to make vulnerability scanning very effectvei

- Nexpose
    - Developed by: Rapid7
        + Same company that developed Metasploit
    + It provides a comprehensive vulnerability report on a target.
    + The vulnerabilities are analysed according to CVE list, CVSS score (0‐10) and skill level (Novice, Intermediate and Expert).
    + It also gives information as to whether the vulnerailities can be exploited by Metasploit.
        
## Resources and References
- CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score
    + CVSS is an industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities
    + Starting from 0.0 (None)
    + Highest is 9.0 - 10.0 (Critical)

- Skill level
    - Maps to "Reliability level" provided in Exploit database (managed by Rapid7)
    - Levels
        + Novice : A novice is able to use the scanner (Reliability - great, excellent)
        + Intermediate
        + Expert 
    - Can be shown in Metasploit
