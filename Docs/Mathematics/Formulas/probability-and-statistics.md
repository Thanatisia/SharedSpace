- Bayes Theorem
    ```
    P(A|B) = [(P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)]

    where:
        - A,B = Events
        - A|B = A = occuring, B = occured
        - P(A|B) = Probability of A assuming B is true
        - P(B|A) = Probability of B assuming A is true;
        - P(A), P(B) = The Independent Probabilities of A and B
    ```
