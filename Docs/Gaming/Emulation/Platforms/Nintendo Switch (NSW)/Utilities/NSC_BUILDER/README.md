[Description from source]
Nintendo Switch Cleaner and Builder: 
    A multi-purpose tool for interacting with Switch game files - a "Switch-Army Knife". 
    Written in Python, Batch, and HTML. 
    Originally developed to remove titlerights and create multicontent NSP/XCI files, though over time has expanded to have significantly more features, specializing in batch processing and file information.

    NSC_Builder is based on the work of blawar’s nut.py and LucaFraga’s hacbuild. The core library, which is known as squirrel, was originally a nut fork, though over time it has added significant functionality and can be considered its own program. NSCB versions > 0.8 no longer rely on hacbuild for XCI generation, rather using its own code.
