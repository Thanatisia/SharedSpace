### Form 1
- Pre-Requisites
    + Equip single handed weapon
    + Equip shield

- Information
    - In Form 1, Thunderblight Ganon (aka 'Ganon') has 2 moves
        1. Shoot electric balls, you just need to dodge this
        2. Speed to you in a zig-zag fashion, you need to block this with a shield/jump back at the right timing

- Strategy
    1. Keep dodging the electric balls shot out by Ganon and blocking with the shield by holding 'L2' until Ganon speeds to you and hit you (but gets parried)
    2. When Ganon is knocked back by your shield, switch to a higher damage weapon and start hitting
    3. Rinse and repeat step 1 until you reach Form 2

### Form 2
- Details
    + In Form 2, Ganon now has lightning on its weapon, will drop lightning rod pillars and has a guardian laser attack at around 1/4 HP remaining

- Strategy
    1. Keep following Form 1 steps 1 and 2 until Ganon drops some lightning rod pillar
    2. Keep blocking, run up to the second floor next to the terminal and start up Magnesis with 'L1', 
        + remember to leave some space between you and the pillars to avoid getting electrocuted
    3. Pick up a pillar and lift it up to Ganon, wait for some lightning bolts to shock him once for a relatively large amount of damage
    4. After getting shocked once, Ganon will start to chase after you, follow Form 1 step 1 and 2 without blocking
        + Do not try to block, you will be electrocuted. Try to dodge instead
        + At the 1/4 HP area, Ganon will start to shoot his guardian laser and be more aggressive.
    5. Rinse and repeat Step 4
