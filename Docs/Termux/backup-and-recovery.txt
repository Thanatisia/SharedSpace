# Documentation - Termux - Backup & Recovery #
#============================================#

Termux is limited when in an unrooted device - however, it is not unusable as a day-to-day editor, terminal, file manager etc.

Backup and Recovery is limited as the FAT32 file system supports only [Read-Only permission], thus, you are unable to perform operations such as
	- Symlinks
	- Paste into Shared Storage Folders

Table of Contents:
	- Backup
	- Recovery

Backup:
	```
	Compress and Backup Dotfiles into a tar file for portability and transport
