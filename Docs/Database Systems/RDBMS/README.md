# Relational Database Management System

## Introduction
### Basics
- There are several types of database system structures
    + RDBMS : This uses Relational Databases and relies on SQL and SQL-based relational schemas where it uses tables, columns and rows
    + NoSQL : Also known as "Not anOther SQL", compared to RDBMS SQL, NoSQL frameworks uses Key-Value object datasets instead of relational schemas

## RDBMS 
### Examples
+ MariaDB : MariaDB is a community-developed, commercially supported fork of the MySQL relational database management system, intended to remain free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License.
+ MySQL : MySQL is an open-source Relational Database Management System. Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter My, and "SQL", the acronym for Structured Query Language
+ [PostgreSQL](postgresql) : PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.
+ MSSQL : aka Microsoft SQL Server, this is Microsoft's enterprise/business-grade SQL server 
+ Oracle Database : Oracle DB is Oracle's enterprise/business-grade SQL Relational Database server software

### Comparisons
- MySQL vs MariaDB
    - Compatibility
        - MySQL has a high level of compatibility, but does not support PL/SQL. 
        - MariaDB has a high level of compatibility and supports PL/SQL since version 10.3. 
    - Replication and Querying
        - MySQL is slightly slower than MariaDB in replication and querying. 
        - MariaDB is slightly faster than MySQL in replication and querying.
- MySQL vs PostgreSQL
    - Relational Database Type
        + MySQL is a purely relational database. 
        - PostgreSQL, on the other hand, is an object-relational database. 
            - This means that in PostgreSQL, you can store data as objects with properties. 
                + Objects are a common data type in many programming languages like Java and .
