# Database Normalisation


Rules to Normalise:
	1. Not Normalized Table
		- If your table contains Multi-values (0..* | 1..*)
		- Split your table into n tables depending on requirements
			- 1x Your Main table WITHOUT the Multivalues
			- (n)x Tables to hold your multivalue values
				- Include the PRIMARY KEY to the Main table/your REFERENCE table
					- This will become the FOREIGN Key
		- This will now be normalized and shouldnt contain any Multivalue values in each table			

	2. 1NF
		- Your Table must be atomic (only has 1 element); No Multi-value tables (0..* | 1..*  etc)
		- Your Table must be a Full Functional Dependency

	3. 2NF
		- Your Table must be 1NF AND 
		- Your Table should not contain any Partial Functional Dependencies

	4. 3NF
		- Your Table must be 2NF AND
		- Your Table should not contain any Transitive Functional Dependencies

	5. BCNF
		- Your Table must be 3NF AND
		- Your Table should not contain any Non-Trivial Functional Dependencies

	6. 4NF
