## Basics
### Summary
+ Git worktree is a core feature in git and is used to traverse into other projects without having to stash and allows developers to checkout and work in multiple git branches simultaneously

### Opening Question
- Why use Git worktree?
    - Assuming you have a project but you are not ready to commit yet
        - Typically you will be asked to stash your project if you try to move to another branch without changing (i.e. using `git checkout` or `git switch`)
            - Stash : Temporarily remove all changes from the index, store them and when you re-checkout the stash, you can pop the changes back
                - Possible Issues
                    + Dependency Hell
        - With git worktree
            + You can check out multiple branches at once

- By default
    - Git only allows you to check out 1 branch at a time
        + The .git folder inside a repository folder is managing all your branches, references, logs
    - Git worktree exists to allow you to define multiple directories in your folder system
        + Where you can link (multiple) copies of branches
            - i.e.
                - repository folder
                    - worktrees
                        + 'main' branch
                        + 'feature1' branch
                        + 'feature2' branch
        + To switch/check out between branches, just change directory to that folder in the machine

### Process/Setup Steps
1. List worktrees
    ```console
    git worktree list
    ```
2. Add directory paths to work tree
    ```console
    git worktree add [path-to-directory/branch-name]
    ```
3. Remove directories from work tree
    ```console
    git worktree remove [path-to-directory]
    ```

        ```
        Repository/
            |
            |-- .git
            |-- README.md
            |-- main.sh

    - Structure
        ```
        feature1/ : Branch within the repository worktree
            |
            |-- main/ : Main branch; This folder is where the branch 'main' will be linked to
        feature2/ : Branch within the repository worktree
            |
            |-- updates/ : Main branch; This folder is where the branch 'updates' will be linked to
        Repository/
            |
            |-- .git
            |-- README.md
            |-- main.sh
        ```

## Setup
### Pre-Requisites
- Change Directory into your project repository
    ```console
    cd [project-repository]
    ```

- Options

### Usage
- List currently linked work trees
    ```console
    git worktree list

- Add/Link a worktree directory to the main repository feature branch
    ```console
    git worktree add path/to/target/directory/[branch-name]
