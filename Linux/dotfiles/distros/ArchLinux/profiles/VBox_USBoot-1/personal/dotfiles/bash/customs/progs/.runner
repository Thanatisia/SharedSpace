# Alias for Runners
# 
# ### NOTE
# Not all languages use a runner; especially compilation-based languages
# - Typically 'scripting languages' like Python use a runner, however
# - Programming languages that requires compilation generates an output executable file; 
# - Thereby removing the need for a runner
