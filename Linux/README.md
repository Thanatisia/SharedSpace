	```
	Dotfiles are in the midst of migrating to [My dotfiles specific repositories](https://github.com/Thanatisia/my-configs-and-dotfiles)
	- The current dotfile folder will ***probably*** be (still a WIP) a Dotfile collection folder for useful dotfiles found. 
		- References will be specified if any.

	- Plans to migrate my Linux scripts to a specific repository - to make the distribution and usage of my scripts more streamlined - are still In-Planning stages.
		- If I do decide to place my scripts in a seperate repository, this folder ***may*** be deleted to clean-up unnecessary folders/files
		- This is an attempt to do some Spring-cleaning on this repository to make it more welcoming.

	- Do communicate/message me if you have ideas or suggestions for improvements in my contacts found in the README.md on the root directory! 
		- All suggestions will be greatly appreciated, thank you for reading!
